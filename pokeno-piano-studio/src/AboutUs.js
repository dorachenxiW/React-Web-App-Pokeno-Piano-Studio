                    Welcome to Poekno Piano Studio, a musical haven founded by Michelle Johnson in 2021. As the heart and soul behind the studio, Michelle envisions a space where the joy of music resonates with every student who walks through the door.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Conveniently located in Pokeno, a charming village nestled alongside the border of Auckland, Poekno Piano Studio serves as a beacon for aspiring musicians in the community. Operating from Wednesday to Sunday, our flexible scheduling ensures that students can pursue their musical aspirations without compromising on other commitments.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At Poekno Piano Studio, we cater to learners of all levels, from beginners taking their first steps in music to advanced students honing their craft. Whether you're aiming to master classical compositions or delve into contemporary melodies, our tailored curriculum and personalized approach ensure that every student receives the guidance they need to flourish.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We understand that music is a universal language, and Michelle is passionate about making it accessible to everyone. With a belief that music knows no boundaries, Michelle fosters an inclusive environment where individuals of all ages and skill levels are encouraged to explore their musical talents.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Currently, Michelle serves as the sole tutor at the studio, but plans are underway to welcome another talented teacher soon. Whether you're seeking one-on-one guidance or prefer the camaraderie of group lessons, Poekno Piano Studio offers both individual and group sessions. Our group lessons are designed to accommodate up to two students per session, fostering collaboration and shared learning experiences.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition to comprehensive music instruction, Poekno Piano Studio prepares students for ABRSM exams, equipping them with the skills and confidence to excel in their musical journey. With a commitment to excellence and a passion for nurturing musical talent, Poekno Piano Studio invites you to embark on a transformative musical adventure.
